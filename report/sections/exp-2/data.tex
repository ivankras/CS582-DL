For better estimations, augmented the data as such:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalized the color channels (input) values to be between 0-1
    \item One-Hot encoded the target labels
    \item Applied a data augmentor that applies random modifications to the data during training, namely small shifts and horizontal flips
\end{itemize}
