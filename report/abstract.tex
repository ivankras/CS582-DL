        Machine Learning models are used to predict data of interest using known data as input.
        Deep Learning uses many-layers Neural Networks for approximating the predictor functions.
        When working with images as input, a special type of networks, called Convolutional Neural Networks, are most effective.\\
        The goal of this project is to implement a classifier for images,
        so to tell if each image is identifiable with one out of ten different labels.
        In the process, a secondary goal is to understand why one networks are more effective than others,
        so we build them for scratch, running to independent experiments with several attempts in each of them.
        Finally, we apply a distilled model\footnote{Knowledge Distillation: \href{https://keras.io/examples/vision/knowledge\_distillation/}{https://keras.io/examples/vision/knowledge\_distillation/}}
        looking to achieve similar performance with a simpler and lighter model.
